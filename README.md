# AWS-2-Becoming-a-Solutions-Architect

This is my portfolio project for the AWS Cloud Computing course.

It highlights my journey in learning how to design, deploy, and manage cloud-based solutions using key AWS services such as:

- **EC2** (Virtual Servers)
- **S3** (Object Storage)
- **IAM** (Access Management)
- **RDS** (Relational Databases)

## About the Project

This site is built with HTML and CSS, and hosted on GitHub Pages.  
It includes an overview of core AWS services, my learning path, and the skills I gained during the course.
